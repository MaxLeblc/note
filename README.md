## Info

This is a React NextJs note-taking application.

For note-taking fanatics, useful or useless, or for those with very little brain RAM.

I created this application to write my notes in a browser, now I'm be extremely happy to search for them in my many tabs.

At last I can create, edit and search my notes in a browser, and they are saved in local storage.

It's a great way of quickly copying and pasting information before writing it clean in Notion.
